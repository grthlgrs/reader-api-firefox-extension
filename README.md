# reader-api-firefox-extension
 A Firefox extension that lets you quickly add links to articles, videos, and other online resources directly to [Reader](https://readwise.io/read) with a simple right-click. 

 I quickly hacked this together by using LLMs. It currently (Nov 2024) works as desired. Feel free to use it without restrictions (CC0). Do not expect any updates or support. Consider forking this project in case you want to expand its capabilities or (eventually) fix it.

 Steps to use:
 - download the .zip file
 - load the extension in Firefox
 - go to the extension's options and add your Reader API token
 - right-click on a link and choose 'Add Link to Readwise Reader'. Done.
